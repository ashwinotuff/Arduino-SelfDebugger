# Arduino-SelfDebugger
Arduino Self-Debugging Embedded System is a fault-tolerant firmware for ATmega328P that detects runtime errors, identifies fault causes, logs crash data to non-volatile memory, automatically recovers from failures, and reports detailed diagnostics after reboot—preventing freezes and erratic behavior.
